Project Description: Image Previewer

Overview:
The Image Previewer project is a simple web application designed to allow users to preview a collection of images by clicking on thumbnails. It provides a larger view of the selected image while dimming the others to emphasize the selected one.

Features:

Image Display: The application displays a main image container and a grid of thumbnail images.
Thumbnail Selection: Users can click on any thumbnail image to view it in the main image container.
Opacity Effect: Upon selection, the opacity of the clicked thumbnail is reduced to highlight the selection while dimming the rest.
Fade-In Animation: The transition between images includes a subtle fade-in animation for a smooth visual effect.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring the web page.
CSS: Styled the page layout and provided animations.
JavaScript: Implemented functionality to switch images and manage opacity.
File Structure:

index.html: Contains the structure of the web page including main and thumbnail image containers.
style.css: Defines the styles for the HTML elements, including layout and animation.
script.js: Implements the functionality for image selection and opacity management using JavaScript.
How to Use:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click on any thumbnail image to preview it in the main image container.
The selected thumbnail will be highlighted with reduced opacity, while the others will be dimmed.
The transition between images includes a fade-in animation for a smooth visual experience.
Additional Notes:

Images used in the project are placeholders and can be replaced with any desired images.
The project can be extended with additional features such as image carousel functionality or dynamic image loading.
This project can serve as a foundation for more complex image previewer applications or galleries.
